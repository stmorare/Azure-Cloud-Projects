This book provides knowledge of general concepts, projects, real-world use cases, and all the essential things you need to know about Microsoft Azure, which will hopefully help you with your day-to-day tasks and work as a developer, cloud architect, or whatever role you get within the cloud today.

Scenarios, examples, and the real-life projects within each chapters will make the most part of this repository, the theory making the less part of this learning journey. I enjoy training that paints a picture of how technology is being used in different industries, and this book offers such content.
