# What is Microsoft Azure?

 - **Microsoft Azure** is a comprehensive suite of cloud services designed to help organizations build, deploy, and manage applications through Microsoft-managed **data centers**.
 - Azure provides a highly flexible, scalable and open platform, supporting a broad selection of operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, databases, and devices.
 - You can find more about Azure Fundamentals and Core Cloud Concepts on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/).
## Features

Let’s look at some of its features:

 - **Global reach**: 
	 - Microsoft operates data centers in numerous regions worldwide, ensuring that Azure services are available wherever you need them.
	 - This extensive network of data centers allows businesses to deploy applications closer to their customers, reducing latency and improving performance.

	- ***EXAMPLE***: a global e-commerce company can use Azure’s data centers in different regions to ensure that their website loads quickly for users in Europe, Asia, and North America.
 
- **Scalability**: 
	- You can easily adjust resources up or down based on demand, ensuring that you only pay for what you use.

	- ***EXAMPLE***: retail companies that experience spikes during holiday shopping seasons.

-  **Security and compliance**: 
	- Azure provides built-in security controls, identity management, and threat detection services.

	- ***EXAMPLE***: Azure’s **identity and access management (IAM)** tools, such as **Azure Active 
			  Directory**, allow businesses to manage user identities and control access to resources securely. This is particularly useful for organizations with stringent security requirements, such as **financial institutions or healthcare providers**.

- **Integration**: 
	- Azure seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft products and services, such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Active Directory.
	- This integration simplifies the management of cloud and on-premises environments, providing a unified and cohesive experience.

	- ***EXAMPLE***: a business using Office 365 for productivity can easily integrate it with Azure  Active Directory to manage user access and enhance security.

- **Flexibility**: 
	- Azure seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft products and services, such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Active Directory.
	- This integration simplifies the management of cloud and on-premises environments, providing a unified and cohesive experience.

	- ***EXAMPLE***: a business using Office 365 for productivity can easily integrate it with Azure  Active Directory to manage user access and enhance security.

## Core Azure Services and Solutions

1. ***Virtual Machines***: 
	-  offer a flexible and scalable way to run applications in the cloud. You can create VMs with various operating systems, including Windows and Linux, and configure them with the resources needed for your applications.

	- ***EXAMPLE***: a development team can use VMs to create isolated environments for testing different software versions without impacting production systems. 
	 
2.   ***Azure App Services***: 

     - is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs. With App Services, you can host applications written in various languages, such as .NET, Java, Node.js, PHP, and Python. The platform handles infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on developing your application.
	  
	  - ***EXAMPLE***: if you are developing a web application, you can use Azure App Services to deploy your app quickly, ensuring high availability and automatic scaling based on demand. The platform also integrates with popular development tools, such as Visual Studio and GitHub, to streamline your development workflow.

3. ***Azure Functions***: 

	-  a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without managing the underlying infrastructure.
	- allows you to focus on writing code while Azure handles the infrastructure.

	- ***EXAMPLE***: an e-commerce website can use Azure Functions to process orders as they are placed, automatically scaling to handle varying loads without any manual intervention.

4. ***Storage Services***:
- Here’s a few examples of **Azure Storage Services**:

	1. **Azure Blob Storage**: is designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents, images, videos, and backups. It is highly scalable and cost-effective, making it suitable for applications that require extensive data storage.
		- ***EXAMPLE***: a media company can use Blob Storage to store and stream video content to users worldwide. Blob Storage supports various access tiers, allowing you to balance cost and performance based on your needs. You can also integrate Blob Storage with other Azure services, such as Azure CDN, to enhance content delivery performance.
		
	2. **Azure File Storage**: provides fully managed file shares in the cloud, accessible via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. This service is useful for scenarios where you need shared storage accessible from multiple virtual machines or applications.
        - ***EXAMPLE***: a global team working on a software project can use Azure File Storage to collaborate on code and documents, ensuring all team members have access to the latest versions.
        
	3.  **Azure Disk Storage**: offers high-performance, durable block storage for use with Azure VMs. It is ideal for applications that require low-latency access to data, such as databases and enterprise applications.
		- ***EXAMPLE***: Game studios and financial firms, such as Pearl Abyss and BlackRock, leverage the extremely high throughput and sub-millisecond latency of Azure Ultra Disk Storage for data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications like online gaming or complex financial modeling.
